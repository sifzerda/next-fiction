    "content": "Story “Whatever good or bad fortune may come our way we can always give it meaning and transform it into something of value.” — Herman Hesse “When the storytelling goes bad in society, the result is decadence.” — Aristotle 1.1 Storytelling The most important skill you need to write fiction is storytelling. Robert McKee defines storytelling as: “the creative conversion of life itself to a more powerful, clearer, more meaningful experience.” 1 He says the essence of storytelling is the ability to evoke a story with a single, silent image. That is the basis of what a storyteller is trying to do. 1.2 What is a Story? 1.2.2 The Opposite of Expectation A story is an event where the opposite of expectation happens, and the more dramatic the contrast, the more interesting the story. This rule applies, not only to stories as a whole, but parts of stories: Acts, chapters, paragraphs, even single sentences. A single unexpected sentence can kick off a story. 1.2.3 More than a Series of Events A story is not simply a random series of events. A series of events becomes a 'story' when there is some extra element —an overarching unifying factor— which transforms the events into a new thing in itself, with a whole greater than the sum of its parts, such that if you took away any piece, it would revert back to being a random series of events. This unifying factor is what the story is 'really' about, and should itself be simple; expressible in little more than a single sentence. A Series of Events: He got up early and went to the gym. Then he went into town and got a haircut. Then he bought a bottle of wine at the liquor store. Later, he washed his car, and picked up his clothes from the dry cleaners. That night he drove to the restaurant and went in. He greeted all the people, said happy birthday to the girl and gave her the wine. Everyone ate and drank, and talked. But he did not talk to the girl at all. Then people began to leave. The girl refused to open his wine, but took it home with her instead. A Story: He got up early and went to the gym. Then he went into town and got a haircut. Then he bought a bottle of wine at the liquor store. Later, he washed his car, and picked up his clothes from the dry cleaners. That night he drove to the restaurant and went in. He greeted all the people, said happy birthday to the girl and gave her the wine. Everyone ate and drank, and talked. But he did not talk to the girl at all. Then people began to leave. The girl refused to open his wine. They had it at her place, instead. But they didn't talk much there, either. In the first example, the series of events is vague and unconnected. But in the story, all the events build up and make sense at the conclusion — every detail had a reason to be there; nothing was random or trivial. The series of events has an overall meaning. In other words, if someone asked you what (1) was about, you could say, a guy goes to a party. But if someone asks you what it meant, you don't know. If someone asks you what (2) was about, you can say, a guy goes to a party. If someone asks you what it meant, you can say, the guy likes the girl, and we find out she likes him back. All of the details are used to communicate this. More than pure chronological content, self-contained meaningfulness is the indicator of a story. 1.2.4 An Explosion Burnett and Burnett 2 say that all stories have an explosion, “...in which all parts of the whole are expelled...” piece by piece, “...from an existing pattern — the lives of the characters are jolted from their rhythm, and chaos is produced in their universe.” In some stories the explosion is fast and shattering, in others, muted and delayed. It may occur at the beginning, middle or end, or the fuse may be lit early and the explosion happen later, but by the end there must be some kind of resolution or meaning created, a sense of something new created from the previous, subverted status quo. 1.2.5 Difference Between 'Story' and 'Idea' Bob Mayer 3 makes a good point that “[an] idea is not [a] story.” How you tell the idea is the story. Different writers can come up with the same idea, but tell different stories. Some good ideas cannot be made into good stories. Conversely, some bad ideas can be made into good stories (you may have heard a critic/reviewer say something like, 'in the hands of another writer, this idea would not have worked...') 1.2.6 Difference between 'Story' and 'Plot' You start with an idea, figure out a story, and then work on the plot. The terms 'story' and 'plot' are often used interchangeably, but don't mean the same things. The same stories tend to get told and retold, but they always have different plots. A 'story' refers to the sequence of events, arranged chronologically, which generate particular meaningfulness. The emphasis is on the events and the order they are arranged in, which creates meaning. If visiting an old, decrepit house at night is a main event, we know this refers to the category 'ghost story.' Conversely, “[a] plot is what you do with that story,” 4 — how you selectively arrange the events chronologically or artistically to create particular meaning, emotions or emphasis. Ten stories may all be ghost stories with the same events (haunted house, dead former tenants, cemetery, ghost, etc), but they will have different plots. One may happen within a single day, or a single hour (like in Stephen King's 1408), and by direct first-person events, another may be spaced over hundreds of years and be uncovered through after-the-fact research done by the protagonist. If asked, “what is your story?” you might say, “A ghost story.” If asked, “What's the plot?” you might then detail the sequence of events which distinguishes your ghost story from other ghost stories. Thus, 'story' emphasises the commonalities of your work with the broader category of similar 'stories'. 'Plot' distinguishes your work from the broader category of similar 'plots'. If your story is like other good stories, that's good. If your plot is like other good plots, that's bad. 1.3 The Main Elements of a Story These are the main elements of story structure, in order of priority: 5 PLOT; CHARACTERS; SETTING; THEME. There are roughly two types of stories: (1) stories about people who 'rise' and end up better off at the end; (2) stories about people who 'fall' and end up worse off at the end (even if a person ends up where they started, they still may be in a worse position; having lost time or opportunities, or not learned anything from their experiences). Throughout your entire planning process you need to bear in mind whether your story is about gain or loss. The tone and structure of your whole story will follow. Regardless which applies, there generally needs to be change and conflict. You may have heard of the 'hero's journey' or the typical story structure where the protagonist faces a challenge, and must overcome it. Don't feel restricted by these formulas. A group of scientists at the University of California researched thousands of books and movie scripts and found that the vast majority of stories actually fall into 6 different categories: 6 Rags to Riches (rise); Riches to Rags (fall); Man in a Hole (fall, then rise); Icarus (rise, then fall); Cinderella (rise, then fall, then rise); Oedipus (fall, then rise, then fall). Incidentally they found Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (among others) was an exception: in which the hero falls, rises, falls, rises, falls, rises, falls, rises, falls, rises, falls, rises, falls, rises, falls, and then finally rises. Roy Clark 7 lists a number of traditional story structures, many of them ancient archetypes: Winning the Prize; Winning or losing a loved one; The blessing becomes the curse; Overcoming obstacles; The wasteland restored; Rising from the ashes; The ugly duckling; The emperor has no clothes; Descent into the underworld (The Orphic Myth); 1.4.1 Rise or Fall? This raises the question; should your story (more importantly, your protagonist) rise or fall? First, a tangential notion; appreciate your story is not the place for a jeremiad. Fiction is a forum for the exploration of viewpoints, not one-sided debate of controversial convictions. Your aim is not to preach to your readers and 'convert' them. You can only support and develop arguments for non-controversial viewpoints which your reader likely held anyway; truisms or even trite-isms are acceptable, such as 'love saves,' 'misdeeds don't pay in the long term,' 'revenge is wrong,' 'loyalty and honesty is rewarded in the long term,' 'defying wrongful authority is a virtue,' 'integrity is better than duplicity,' and 'stand up for your beliefs,' etc. Your goal is not to present a novel, original, controversial argument, but to portray a timeless argument in an original, novel way. More relevantly, if your protagonist stands for timeless values, your story is justified in being a 'rise' story, because the protagonist's ultimate triumph validates those undisputed values. Conversely, if your protagonist stands for controversial or just plain wrong values, it justifies a 'fall' story. This creates an exception to my earlier point against jeremiads; your protagonist can be a 'preacher' if they don't ultimately triumph; in this way, you don't side with your protagonist, rather, you are proving the contrary by deduction ('if the protagonist had not done that, he would have succeeded...'). Also, don't define 'triumph' as black/white; think of it as a spectrum — the protagonist who ultimately obtains a large sum of money paid with the life of their (innocent) love interest would not count as a 'triumph.' Don't confuse the characters' feelings with the readers'. Also, make the protagonist's rise/loss proportionate to the radicalism of their beliefs; a protagonist who is spectacularly polarised should fail spectacularly; a protagonist whose beliefs are more nuanced or equivocal may fail partly and win partly. 1.5 Joseph Campbell's Myths No discussion of storytelling would be complete without mentioning Joseph Campbell's universal 'myths,' his most known being 'The Adventure of the Hero,' more commonly known as 'The Hero's Journey.' 8 Campbell argues that virtually every story (including folk tales, mythologies and fairy tales) is a variation on his formula. The way the myths manifest in stories is manifold: the myths may occur in stories literally or symbolically, overtly or impliedly, and be present in physical or intangible forms. The roles may be occupied by characters — alternatively male or female — multiple characters performing collective roles, singular characters performing multiple roles, animals, objects, settings, or other. This gives the journey enormous scope for application. For a detailed summary of the Hero's Journey, see 1.6 Myths and Misconceptions 1.6.1 Write What You Know Writers are commonly instructed to 'Write what [they] know.' But, as Alice LaPlante says, this can be limiting. 9 \"Write about what you don't know about what you know,\" Eudora Welty suggests. Take what you know and create a mystery from it; you might see your accountant neighbour leave at one in the morning every Saturday, but where is he/she going? You can write anything you want. Stephen Crane wrote about the American Civil War in The Red Badge of Courage, even though he'd never been to war. Your writing will be better if you research your chosen topic/s first, or while writing. Don't let anyone discourage you from writing about something you have not personally experienced, otherwise you risk writing nothing more ambitious than what Robert McKee 10 calls 'the personal story,' — basically a fictionalized diary entry. 1.6.2 Don't Take Ideas from Other Writers Anyone who gives a blanket proscription against 'stealing' ideas (it's not really 'borrowing' if you never give them back) is out of touch with writing practice. 99% of fiction writers are readers of other fiction writers, or 'fans', and hence get their ideas from someone else. However, some forms of 'copying' (or more politically correct: 'drawing inspiration') are more permissible than others: (1) Steal More If your 'stealing' is easily found out, ironically you're probably not stealing enough. There's a saying: “If you steal from one person it's plagiarism, steal from many, it's research.” Just by reading many different authors on the same idea, or better, across many different kinds of ideas or themes, is going to enrichen your 'idea base', and when it comes to writing your own, the 'cross-fertilisation' of ideas will mask your tracks, burying the echoes of one author under the echoes of all the others, and making it less clear where one 'stolen' idea begins and another ends; Note: Avoid slavishly copy-pasting ideas, even in mass volume. A ton of shit is no less shit than an ounce of shit. Borrow ideas lots of ideas, yes, but borrow selectively. If you think purely having read thousands of stories makes you a better writer, note what Robert McKee 11 says about writing 'instinct': “...[W]hat the novice mistakes for craft is simply his unconscious absorption of story elements from every novel, film, or play he's ever encountered. As he writes, he matches his work by trial and error against a model built up from accumulated reading and watching. The unschooled writer calls this \"instinct,\" but it's merely habit and it's rigidly limiting…But the haphazard groping toward or revolt against the sum of unconsciously ingrained repetitions is not, in any sense, technique, and leads to screenplays clogged with clichés of either the commercial or the art house variety.” (2) Steal Further Back There's a variation on the above: \"If we steal thoughts from the moderns, it will be cried down as plagiarism; if from the ancients, it will cried up as erudition\" 12 So if you want to take from 'Dracula', don't stop with Dracula itself, but read the origin myths and real life historical background which gave rise to the story. (3) Aim Lower Writers are most tempted to steal from the most widely-known, or idolized, 'untouchable' works. For instance, in fantasy, Lord of the Rings. Hypocritically, the writer believes the work cannot be improved. If you cannot improve the original work, then why are you trying to get published? What will the public get from your work that Lord of the Rings did not already give them? In contrast, do you remember a time you've read a book and thought 'How did that turn out so bad? That could've been really good.' Those are the books you want to steal from. You want to rewrite the book the way you think it should've gone. Even if the story is well known, this form of copying is more permissible because you are making active changes to the story. 1.6.2 Slavishly adhere to good spelling and grammar I refer to this misconception later on, but for now I'll just say this is untrue. You should adhere to conventional grammar and spelling unless your story starts to not make sense if you don't. 'Flowers for Algernon' by Daniel Keyes is a clear example, so much that the story would have been nonsensical if perfect grammar had been used from the start. 1.6.3 Show don't Tell As a basic rule, description which 'shows' should be prioritized before description which 'tells'. But there are exceptions, such as: To designate a passage of time separating critical 'showing' scenes; To provide a break from the intensity of a scene; To provide a transition between scenes; To describe the character acting on autopilot (e.g. driving for a long period of time without much cognizance of surroundings); 1.6.5 Characters are collections of assorted personality traits There is writing advice which instructs that characters are basically a bunch of personality traits, as close to real people you know as possible. This is not a helpful way of thinking about character construction. Characters are not meant to be 'real people on paper'; nor are they meant to be a collection of personality traits you think up one rainy day. Characters are motivation. You create characters out of necessity — because you need a character to do some particular thing in the story. They are not there, like so much human wallpaper at a high flying party, to stand around looking attractive and telling jokes and blending into the environment. Characters are instruments. 1.6.6 Verisimilitude, not Truth It's no defence to a charge that your story is unbelievable or boring or poorly structured or nonsensical to say 'but it was like that in real life.' Lots of things, all kinds of things, happen in real life, and most of them aren't story-worthy. Stories aren't real life like characters aren't real people. 1.7 The Philosophy of Storytelling Misery, Conflict and Struggle are the lifeblood of captivating story. If you don't want to write about those things, or you can't, your story won't be worth telling. Robert McKee 13 puts it better: “As Jean-Paul Sartre expressed it, the essence of reality is scarcity, a universal and eternal lacking. There isn't enough of anything in this world to go around. Not enough food, not enough love, not enough justice, and never enough time [...] Writers who cannot grasp the truth of our transitory existence, who have been mislead by the counterfeit comforts of the modern world, who believe that life is easy once you know how to play the game, give conflict a false inflection. Their scripts fail for one of two reasons: either a glut of meaningless and absurdly violent conflict, or a vacancy of meaningful and honestly expressed conflict. The former are exercises in turbo special effects, written by those who follow textbook imperatives to create conflict, but, because they're disinterested in or insensitive to the honest struggles of life, devise phony, overwrought excuses for mayhem. The latter are tedious portraits written in reaction against conflict itself. These writers take the Pollyanna view that life would really be nice ... if it weren't for conflict. Therefore, their films avoid it in favor of low-key depictions to suggest that if we learned to communicate a little better, be a little more charitable, respect the environment, humanity could return to paradise. But if history has taught us anything, it's that when toxic nightmare is finally cleaned up, the homeless provided shelter, and the world converted to solar energy, each of us will still be up to our eyebrows in mulch.” Yikes. 1.8 Medium It's worth considering whether your story makes the most of your chosen medium (writing/literature). Your story might make a great film, or video game, but a poor novel. Right now, audiences love superhero comics, superhero films and superhero video games, but no one reads superhero novels. The superhero genre seems to need images to work. Compare with horror. Most horror is uniquely suited to written media because it's largely 'visual-avoidant' by undermining visual and direct information in favour of other forms (inference, sound, anecdote, etc). For instance, in horror, the last thing you want to do is give away the 'visual' or the 'sighting' prematurely (if at all). Not to say visual horror is ineffective — it has the intensity of fireworks, but unfortunately, also has the lifespan of fireworks. The visual horror creator has to keep contriving to put the source of horror out of sight 'until later.' The novel 'Bird Box' 14 is a perfect example of visual-avoidant horror's efficacy: the plot involves monsters invading earth which, if you look at, you go crazy. A film requires a lot of narrative and camera gymnastics to get around this glaringly visual-avoidant plot point. Whereas, the same concept has no problem in literature: if it's not seen, it's not described. End of story. Same with crime fiction; it's purpose is to keep certain visual information (the criminal, the crime itself) hidden from you for as long as possible. This makes it literature-friendly. Romance also has distinct literary appeal over visual media. You could argue it's a downside that you don't see the romantic interests, but on the positive side, you get to fill in their appearances with your own preferences — or yourself. Visual media cannot 'self-insert'; and (as Hollywood's star system testifies) the actor's likeability is a huge barrier to engagement. On the other hand, notice how the Verne-style 'adventure' novel has all but died in literature, but survives in film and video game? The 'Western' has gone one step further, dying in literature and film, but surviving in video game. Genres that work in writing: Horror; Romance/Erotica; Art/Indie; Crime; Weird Fiction; Thriller; Political; Post/Modern/Subversive; Hard Sci-Fi; Complex or High Fantasy; Historical; Philosophical; Experimental; Psychological; Postmodern; Metafiction; Genres that work in visual media (film video games): Adventure; Horror Romance; Western; Action; Space Opera; High Fantasy; Simple Historical; Superhero; Some genres are equally effective across both mediums, but operate distinctly different. An example being comedy: in written medium, humour is reliant on how you tell the joke, i.e. the language itself. Poor language can ruin a funny situation. In film, humour is derived from situation, acting and reaction. There are no firm rules about these distinctions, but if you want to work out whether your story is better suited for literature or film (or other media), consider: Is the plot complicated or straightforward? Intricately complex plots suit literature because books give people pause to think and rationalise. Is the story reliant on visual information? Less visual stories work better as literature, whereas stories which rely on visualization work better as a film; Is critical information metered out gradually until a big reveal at the end? This can work well as literature; Did critical events happen in the past? This suits literature which is less focused on showing the 'here and now' than film Is there a long history spanning hundreds of years, a large cast of near hundred/s, or other risk of 'information overload'? This suits literature, which has more time and endurance to deal with detail density, which would fatigue a film (and blow its budget) 1.9 Pixar Storytelling Animation company Pixar has a list of tips which it has used in its films: You admire a character for trying more than for their successes. You gotta keep in mind what's interesting to you as an audience, not what's fun to do as a writer. They can be v. different. Trying for theme is important, but you won't see what the story is actually about til you're at the end of it. Now rewrite. Once upon a time there was ___. Every day, ___. One day ___. Because of that, ___. Because of that, ___. Until finally ___. Simplify. Focus. Combine characters. Hop over detours. You'll feel like you're losing valuable stuff but it sets you free. What is your character good at, comfortable with? Throw the polar opposite at them. Challenge them. How do they deal? Come up with your ending before you figure out your middle. Seriously. Endings are hard, get yours working up front. Finish your story, let go even if it's not perfect. In an ideal world you have both, but move on. Do better next time. When you're stuck, make a list of what WOULDN'T happen next. Lots of times the material to get you unstuck will show up. Pull apart the stories you like. What you like in them is a part of you; you've got to recognize it before you can use it. Putting it on paper lets you start fixing it. If it stays in your head, a perfect idea, you'll never share it with anyone. Discount the 1st thing that comes to mind. And the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th — get the obvious out of the way. Surprise yourself. Give your characters opinions. Passive/malleable might seem likable to you as you write, but it's poison to the audience. Why must you tell THIS story? What's the belief burning within you that your story feeds off of? That's the heart of it. If you were your character, in this situation, how would you feel? Honesty lends credibility to unbelievable situations. What are the stakes? Give us reason to root for the character. What happens if they don't succeed? Stack the odds against. No work is ever wasted. If it's not working, let go and move on - it'll come back around to be useful later. You have to know yourself: the difference between doing your best & fussing. Story is testing, not refining. Coincidences to get characters into trouble are great; coincidences to get them out of it are cheating. Exercise: take the building blocks of a movie you dislike. How do you rearrange them into what you DO like? You gotta identify with your situation/characters, can't just write 'cool'. What would make YOU act that way? What's the essence of your story? Most economical telling of it? If you know that, you can build out from there. Leave a Comment Please log in to leave a comment.

    "title": "Premise",
    "content": "Premise “Even the most complicated stories start with a very simple premise.” — Chris Van Allburg 2.1: Your Story In One Sentence The premise is the essence of your plot. You should be able to sum up your story in one sentence. If you can't, you will be unable to pitch your story in an intention-grabbing way. 2.1.1 Difference between Premise and Plot By contrast, your plot is a little more detailed; it suggests a beginning, middle and end. Unlike premises, plots contain goals (forces of progression) and obstacles (forces of regression). Consider which of the following premises constitute a plot: A man uses a portal to travel back in time; A girl's identical twin mysteriously vanishes; A bunch of kids wash up on a deserted island; A young boy discovers he is a wizard; A woman is terrorized by a rabid dog; Aliens invade Earth and start exterminating humanity; A group of strangers stay the night in a haunted house; The answer is: none of the above. These are all premises. Why? None of these examples have plot direction. They constitute larger worlds but don't provide the tighter narrative pathway which will explore the larger world. They don't have both goals and obstacles. Without these, your main character is merely a tourist or sightseer in their own story; they have nothing to do other than observe the events randomly happening around them. By contrast, the following premises do constitute plots: A man uses a portal to travel back in time to kill Hitler; A girl searches for answers after her identical twin mysteriously vanishes; After washing up on a deserted island, a bunch of kids slowly turn on each other in their desperation to survive; A young boy discovers he is a wizard and is destined to kill the dark lord wizard; A woman is terrorized by a rabid dog and must protect her son; After aliens invade Earth and start exterminating humanity, a man must leave his home and seek shelter; To win a million dollar prize, a group of strangers stay the night in a haunted house; The above give the main characters a direction, a goal. You suggest, of the infinite possibilities which spring from the idea (time travel, wizardry, alien invasion, etc) which angle you are going for, which tells your reader what your story is actually about. 2.1.2 X in Y A quick formula for generating a basic plot is putting X character in Y situation — this has the bonus of creating a protagonist as well. The situation (or location) should act as a foil for the character, emphasizing the character's traits and increasing conflict. This is a great starter for short stories. Examples: What if a cynical ghost hunting skeptic was in a genuinely haunted house? 1 What if an intellectually handicapped man was in an experiment that made him a genius? 2 What if a typical, conservative 1950s breadwinning husband started physically shrinking? 3 Note this method doesn't work if your protagonist is an 'everyman' or ordinary person in an abnormal situation — in that case, the plot is the abnormal situation. But here, like Yin and Yang, the plot is a combination of the protagonist and the situation — you can't subtract or replace either. For instance, you can't switch Carrie in Carrie with any of the other kids, because her timid, agreeable, repressive nature builds the conflict, however you could switch Harry Potter with another kid in Harry Potter, because his personality doesn't build the conflict (outside events do). Compare with a story which is not 'X in Y' — Jurassic Park by Michael Crichton. You can put any characters in a living Dinosaur Park and it'll be interesting seeing them try to survive. Also goes for any story with a survival element (e.g. Lord of the Flies by William Golding, Arena by Matthew Reilly, The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins). 2.1.3 A Bridge Too Far An idea related to X in Y is to give your protagonist special capability, knowledge or experience, and put them in a situation which requires them to use that capability, knowledge or experience, but seems to be a little above their abilities. 2.3: Building the Story from the Premise 'How to Write' advice tends to suggest starting with a character and an obstacle, or a challenge. When I kick start a story I normally start with a character and a question. A question should not be rhetorical or abstract. It should create the subject for the plot; above all. You pose the question not to the protagonist, but the reader — the question should be something the reader wants answered, and they will read the rest of the story to get the answer. A good question might begin: 'What If...?' For instance, here's an idea I made up on the spot: Protagonist is up late one night at home and hears a strange sound pass over their house. They go outside and find a mysterious smoking object sitting in their backyard. This builds the question: 'What if someone found some alien technology?' Notice this does not create an obstacle or a challenge — that comes later. At this point you could start building an 'E chain'. Start with the three major plot points (events) creating the plot arc (generally: (1) Challenge (2) Complication (3) Solution) for example: Protagonist finds mysterious object; Protagonist gets pursued by mysterious security personnel; Protagonist destroys the object. Or: Protagonist finds mysterious object; Protagonist uses object and is sent to the future; Protagonist returns to present time. Or: Protagonist finds mysterious object; Protagonist is stalked by a terrifying alien presence; Protagonist's alien infection starts turning him into an alien. Or: Protagonist finds mysterious object; Protagonist is beamed to alien planet; Protagonist marries alien prince/princess. I give different examples to show that your question should not lock you into a predetermined 'answer.' At this stage your story can still be about whatever you want, in whatever genre you want. To further expand the E chain, let's take one of the above examples: [event] Protagonist finds mysterious object; [event] Protagonist is beamed to alien planet; [event] Protagonist is married to an alien prince/princess For each 'Event,' you're brainstorming to resolve why the event happens, in the most interesting, dynamic ways you can think of. Refer to 'Encouragement' and 'Effect', to create a logical chain of activity. For example, starting with number one: [event] Protagonist finds mysterious object; [event] Protagonist is beamed to alien planet; [event] Protagonist is married to an alien prince/princess [event] Protagonist finds mysterious object; [encouragement] why does the protag investigate the noise, rather than ignore it? [encouragement] why does the protag take the object and keep it, rather than discard it? [effect] why does the protag take the object and keep it, rather than discard it? [effect] why does the protag take the object and keep it, rather than discard it? You could just say your protag has a curious and investigative personality, but this is easy and uninteresting. Alternatively, you could set up that your protag's beloved GF/BF recently ended their relationship because they found protag boring. That is a more interesting incentive for your protag to investigate the object, particularly if they suspect it came from space. Surely a discovery of an alien artefact makes someone highly interesting. It also raises a great potential sub-plot about your protag trying to get back their ex — and notice how this raises interesting conflict with the 'married to alien' event later. We can use this brainstorming to flesh out the E chain (remember that 'encouragement' comes before 'event' even though below I've put it under event): [event] Protagonist finds mysterious object; [enouragement] Protag dumped by ex for being 'boring'; wants to use object to disprove this to ex; [effect] protagonist investigates and experiments with object; [enouragement] Protagonist does not tell anyone about object, wanting to get the credit for discovering it to impress ex; [event] Protagonist is beamed to alien planet; [enouragement] Protag wants to return home to be with ex and attempts to befriend and flatter alien prince/princess to get them to return him/her home to Earth; [effect] The alien prince/princess falls in love with protag; [event] Protagonist is married to an alien prince/princess; [effect] Earth learns of this and protag is made diplomat representing Earth to alien planet; [effect] Ex realises protag — diplomat for Earth and discoverer of aliens — has become most interesting person on the planet and regrets dumping them; [effect] Protag declines ex's plea to resume relationship OR protag divorces alien and gets back with repentant ex OR other It's beginning to look like a 'chain' now. You may find less instances of encouragement as you go along — that's fine. Encouragement winds the characters' up into performing plot-relevant action. If you set it up substantially early on (as you should be) you'll find it will cover you for the rest of the story. Now you can take number two and three and repeat the process. You can then repeat the process on the encouragement and effects — for instance, if protag gets back with ex, why? Has ex changed? How and why? These questions need to be answered through their own scenes. This is where the challenges and obstacles (above) come in: You want to continually ask 'what if' to generate the most interesting scenarios. For instance, what if the alien prince/princess realised the protag retained feelings for the ex, jealously abducted the ex to be put to death? What if the protag loved the alien planet and the alien prince/princess better than Earth and the ex, but every visit to its toxic atmosphere harmed the protag. What if the alien prince/princess impregnated protag? What if it looked like protag had a chance with ex again, but ex was killed? What if protag had to choose between ex and the alien planet/princess/prince? What if the alien prince/princess had protag turned into an alien? What if Earth waged war on the aliens, and protag had to choose a side? Notice the above questions centre on the relationships. In this plot, that's where the interest lies because it's the encouragement — the thing pushing the protagonist on. If you want to run a different kind of 'what if' like 'what if the aliens threaten to blow up the planet' you need to tie it into the protag's incentives, for instance, this makes protag comply with aliens' demands because if planet blew up, ex would die. But if protag doesn't like ex anymore, it's not a good plot point because saving the world at large gives no direct connection for the reader to relate to, particularly if protag has a surrogate home — the alien planet — to remain on. So you can see how important former encouragement is for subsequent events. 2.3.1 Start Big When using an E Chain, once you have brainstormed multiple possible stories and you're figuring out which brainstormed scenes to pursue (and which to abandon), prioritize your biggest scenes, or most interesting scenes. 2.4: Structuring the plot with live issues In basic form, a novel is where you tell the reader 'stick around for the next 200 pages and something excellent will happen.' Why not save the reader time and condense your story into a short story, 3000 words ending with something excellent? Or, why not just tell the reader the 'excellent' thing immediately? Why go to the bother? The novel must be something more: generally every 3000 words something good is happening (a 'live issue'), and by the end, something excellent has happened (the climax). 2.4.1 What is a 'Live issue'? What is the aforementioned 'something good' that litters the story? Answer: a 'live issue'. A live issue is a plot element which raises an issue that demands resolution. It's a plot detail that causes the reader to ask questions and demand answers (who, what, when, where, why, how). “Good stories need an engine, a question the story answers for the reader. Who done it? Guilty or not guilty? Who will win the race? Which man will she marry? Will the hero escape, or die trying? Good questions drive good stories.” — Roy Clark 4 \"Plant little queries along the way, little hints and teasers. Then answer them one by one, substituting new queries as you do.\" — David Carroll 5 Live issues must accord with all of these criteria: They relate to the plot; They help or hinder the protagonist; and The issue puts something at stake; Insinuating that a side character is hiding a secret is not a live issue. But, insinuating that a side character is hiding a secret from the protagonist, which bears on the plot, is a live issue. Other times, the reader already knows the answer to the live issue's question, they just want to see it play out — that's also acceptable, as long as you ask the right question. It's critical to structure your plot with live issues. Without, your story will be a guaranteed flop. You literally fail to provide your reader any reason to read it. Sphere by Michael Crichton, is a good example of a plot structured with live issues. The main plot issue is: What is the Sphere? Wisely, the novel does not limit itself that question. Each chapter raises a new question/s to continue to feed the reader's interest and reward their continued reading. Examples of live issues raised throughout: 2.4.2 Examples of live issues Protag gets summoned to a secret military/navy base (why?); An alien spaceship was found in the deep sea (What? how? Why?); The spaceship has never before seen human technology (how?); The ship's original crew is missing (where?) The physicist starts talking ominously like something bad will happen to them (why? What?) A piece of alien technology — the sphere — is found on the ship (what?) A character is seen entering the sphere (how?) The previous character won't say what was in the sphere (why?) A single mummified crew mate is discovered in a secret room that wasn't there before (how? Who?) Marine life is found with impossible anatomy (how? What?) More marine life is found but now with the correct anatomy (why?) The ship's AI communicates to the crew (who? How?) Bad things happen because an antagonist entered the sphere, but once he is incapacitated, bad things still happen (why? How?) Different rooms in the spaceship change appearance inexplicably (how? Why?) Protag accuses female character of entering the sphere, female cross-accuses same about protag (who?) Multiple different characters acting out of character (why?) With each new question raised, you get increasingly pumped for the conclusion, which you expect to answer all these questions, and it does. Also, although different questions are answered at different times, Crichton never answers all his questions; there is always at least one question open. Even better, some of the answers actually raise more questions. Lastly, the ending does not directly answer all of the questions, but throughout the story, enough information is provided for the reader to answer those questions themselves — this is a great way to encourage multiple reading, or just keeping the story in your reader's mind to encourage discussion with others, and possibly recommendation. Ira Levin is another author skilled at using live issues, see for instance in the Stepford Wives: What happened to the women's association? What do the men do at the men's association? Why do the women act strangely? Was the talkative police officer in on the 'plot'? Is Dale a robot? What happened to Bobby? What did Bobby do with the knife? What happened to Joanne? Are the women altered with robotics, or entirely replaced with robots? and if they're replaced, do the original women get killed? Was Walter in on the 'plot'? Who is 'in' on it, and who isn't? Levin is also great at resolving his issues; or not resolving them. His thriller The Stepford Wives is a lesson in the economy of suspense; he only gives you the threadbare information to get the gist of what's going on, without outright telling you, and like Crichton, leaves specific details unexplained at the end. 2.4.3 ...And Foreclosure If you raise issues, you must give them satisfying closure. Generally, this means, if you raised questions, you must provide answers, and if you make promises you must deliver. Exceptions: Note, in the 'Sphere' example above, I mentioned some issues were raised and left unanswered. For instance, one of these issues was, at any one time, precisely who is acting under the influence of the Sphere — by the end of the story, as long as it's revealed how the Sphere works on the characters generally, we don't need to know who was specifically affected at all times — it would be interesting to know, but not necessary. This was acceptable, as certain exceptions applied, e.g. The issue was relatively unimportant, compared to other issues; Nothing was at stake if the issue went unresolved; The issue was created by implication, rather than expressed outright; No answer would have been more effective than leaving the reader to wonder (i.e. the 'closed door' rule) 2.4.4 Turning Dead Issues Into Live Issues INSERT STUFF HERE 2.5: The 'Strange Sandwich' Never write strange on strange. Your plot can be strange, but your reader needs to be able to contrast the strangeness with commonplace real life. Therefore, you should never layer strange plot elements on strange elements — e.g. strange characters layered on a strange setting — otherwise the reader won't have anything solid to contrast the strange against. As with anything, strangeness is only apparent by contrast with its opposite, normality. As an example of 'strange on strange' I saw a story idea posted on Reddit where characters are on an alien planet, trapped in a 4D labyrinth, and being hunted down by an alien monster. Cool idea, but utterly unrelatable. Any single one of those ideas is stronger on its own, against a backdrop of normality. But all combined, risks giving the reader 'strangeness' fatigue. My E chain plot example further above has 3 strange elements — A weird alien device; An alien planet/civilization; An alien prince/princess. This is okay as long you separate each strange element and relate it to, or backdrop it against, something ordinary to 'normalize' it. Once a strange element has been normalized, you can then introduce another strange element. Think of it like separating exotic sandwich ingredients each with another slice of bread: too much bread together tastes bland, but too many exotic ingredients together and flavours clash or cancel each other out. To normalize each strange element, try to pair it with something relatable in real life, for example: [A weird alien device] → A person digs up a strange object/artefact/antique in their backyard [An alien planet/civilization] → A person is lost in the wilderness [An alien prince/princess] → Meeting someone from a totally foreign culture There are countless examples you could think up. For example, maybe the protag steals the alien device from a museum or bids for it at a junk sale; weird but relatable. Maybe protag watches a sci-fi video before realizing he is viewing footage of the actual alien planet (people can relate better to watching something strange on TV than seeing it in real life). Maybe protag communicates long distance with the alien prince/princess for a long time, before meeting him/her in person and realizing he/she's an alien — people can relate to long distance communication where the person in real life doesn't seem anything like their long distance self.

    "content": "Plot “For the purposes of [a story] a convincing impossibility is preferable to an unconvincing possibility.” — Aristotle “The King died and then the Queen died is a story. The King died, and then the Queen died of grief, is a plot.” — E. M Forster 3.1: Plotting in a Vacuum You might have more stories than the Burj Khalifa. But stories aren't enough; you've got to know what to do with them. At the front-end of story creation, writers tend to think: 'What do I already know, and how can I make a plot based on what I already know?' What you should be asking is, 'What is an ideal plot, and what do I need to know to write it?' 3.2: Types of Plots Robert McKee 1 makes the distinction between three different kinds of plots: Archplot (the 'Hero' story) Miniplot (the 'journey' story) Antiplot (the 'not a logical story' story) Nonplot (the 'not a story' story) McKee strongly advises writers not to start writing plots (2) — (4) until they've mastered the Archplot. This is because the other plots are subversions of the Archplot; they take its elements and alter or challenge or remove them. You can't do that effectively unless you're highly familiar and confident with use of those elements in the first place. In other words, you must pass the foundation course (the Archplot) before you can move on to the advanced course (Miniplot, Antiplot and Nonplot). 3.2.1 Archplot Your standard kind of story. Typified by: Plots structured by physical events; Active protagonist A closed ending (story threads wrap up and resolve); An identifiable protagonist (may be an everyman or larger than life 'hero,' but in traits distinguished from the other characters); External Conflict (caused by other people, social institutions, or natural forces); No intellectual work required by the audience; Linear timeframe; Example: Star Wars. 2 3.2.2 Miniplot Typified by: Minimalism; Plots structured by emotional events; An open ending (story threads unresolved, some remaining questions); Internal Conflict (inner struggles and battles with one's self); Passive protagonist; Multiple protagonists; Intellectual work required by the audience Nonlinear timeframe; Example: Lost in Translation. 3 3.2.3 Antiplot Typified by: Plot structured by coincidence over causation; Ridicule, parody, irony and satire; Intellectual work required by the audience; Example: Seinfeld. 4 3.2.4 Nonplot The Nonplot is basically is where there isn't a clear, satisfying conclusion to the events. Typified by: Plotless; Character-driven; Intellectual work required by the audience; Example: The Big Lebowski. 5 The difference between the Antiplot and the Nonplot is that the former is generally made in jest or for satirical effect, done in a super-real style. Whereas, the latter is more realistic and may be sobering and insightful. 3.3: The Inciting Incident This is the event which kicks off the plot. It's the first 'unusual' thing which occurs to your protagonist, jarring them out of their normal routine and necessitating their pursuit of the plot-worthy goal in order to return to normal. A story where the protagonist one day wakes up and changes their mind about the direction of their life, is weak, vague and lazy. We don't assume people just do this spontaneously in real life, we assume something happened to cause their change of mind. In real life, we don't take people's word for it when they tell us they've suddenly decided to change their life; we tend to ask, 'why? What caused you to decide this?' or, meaningfully, 'Did something happen?' The Inciting Incident also suggests your protagonist is not in control; control of their life has been wrestled away from them, and the story is about them reclaiming control. This is more interesting than a character who remains in the driver's seat of their life the whole time, whatever sudden decisions they make. It goes without saying, the inciting incident should be zany, unusual, riveting. It should make the reader wonder what they would do if they found themselves in the same circumstances. It shouldn't be some throwaway event excused by the fact that more interesting things happen later. If anything, there's a good argument the inciting incident needs to be one of the most exciting parts of the entire story, because, like a stone hitting the surface of a pond, everything that happens from that point radiates out from the inciting incident. 3.4: Three Act Structure The Three Act Plot is a story formula involving three major changes or reversals of positions for the protagonist. For instance, things are good, then they're bad, then they're good again. The Acts are: Good, Bad, Good (if the climax is in the Third Act, you might find the third 'Good' only spans the last half/quarter of the Act). The first Act might be about 25% of the story. The Second Act will be longer, and then the Third Act will be the shortest, to create a sense of accelerating pace to the climax. Maybe max 25% of the story. The potential problem is that the Second Act drags. Rectifying that may involve adding a subplot/s or another Act (e.g. extending to Good, Bad, Worse, Good). McKee 6 suggests a three Act plot needs four memorable scenes (the inciting incident, and each Act's climax). I would argue for more. The Harry Potter books had scores of memorable scenes which didn't fit into the above categories: the Quidditch games, the spell classes, sorting hat — there was no end to them. I would also argue that you risk transparency if your memorable scenes are the important ones — you give the reader that many more clues as to how you've structured your story 'behind the curtain.' The reader will think 'oh, this scene's fairly unmemorable, it mustn't be integral to the plot.' Memorable 'in-between' scenes throw the reader off your trail, because the reader is tempted to include them in a structured analysis of your plot, whereas you know those scenes are decoys for the integral stuff. Never let your reader become more of an expert on your story than you are. Besides, why stop at four? Why not try to make as many scenes memorable as possible? Blake Snyder 7 says the 3 acts in a story represent 3 different worlds: Thesis, Antithesis, and Synthesis. Thesis is the world as is. It's the world and its rules set up for us. Antithesis is the reverse or 'upside-down' version or 'funhouse mirror reflection' of the world. Characters from 'Thesis' may reappear in 'Antithesis' in different forms. The Synthesis is a combination of the first two worlds. What the hero had in worlds 1 and 2, becomes the 'Third way' in world 3. By this time, the hero has 'died' and been 'reborn', so he can't go back to world 1 as the same person. He returns having learned and retained things from world 2, therefore combining the two in world 3. The change doesn't have happen instantaneously, it should happen bit by bit — every scene in the structure changes the hero a little. There's another dimension to this structure, two intertwining forces: the hero's tangible goal (what he wants), and his spiritual goal (what he needs). For instance, the hero may be chased by a monster (tangible goal = to survive), realising that this means his mentor has failed to protect him from it (spiritual goal = security, trust). As the monster closes in, the hero's awful realisation crystallizes. The hero must ditch the defective belief (that mentor will protect him) to attain the spiritual goal, effecting his transformation (from dependent to self-sufficient), allowing him to ditch the monster, and gain the tangible goal. 3.4.1 Sub-Plots Sub-plots are not only conceptually plots in miniature, they also resemble them in form. They have their own Act structure, Inciting Incidents, and climaxes. However, a sub plot may comprise of a single Act, or more. You can have multiple subplots, and they can overlap. You can also retire subplots for periods at a time, only to resolve them much later. Climaxes for sub-plots and the main plot can also happen in the same scene, e.g. the protagonist defeats the villain (climax of main plot) and by doing so, wins object of affection's love (climax of subplot). McKee 8 also says that main plots and subplots can have different protagonists (though I'm struggling to see how this would work). My caveat is, if you do this, ensure: The subplot/s tie back into the main plot's theme, i.e. the sub-plots are variations on a theme; The subplot protagonist lives in the same world, or a connected world to the main protagonist. For example, Atreyu and Bastien in The Neverending Story lived in different worlds, but their worlds were interconnected enough for Bastien to be able to visit Atreyu's world, and for both characters to affect each other. The subplot protagonist's character reflects the main protagonist's character, whether alike, a foil, an invert, a branching off parallelism, etc. I.e. the protagonists aren't completely unrelated people who could just be any random strangers in the street. 3.5: Three Right-Angled Turns Aristotle 9 wrote of the “peripeteia,” or “reversal of the situation.” At the end of the first act, your protagonist makes a 'turn' which sets them off from where they were. Ideally this will be a 'diametric' turn (see 6.5 Diametrics). Normally they will end up in a worse position, but might not. Being set off in a different but equal position may be bad, as it requires time and energy for the protagonist to readjust. At the end of the second act, your protagonist makes another turn, which sets them off both from their previous position and the starting position. So you can't just turn them back where they were in starting position (otherwise there is no point to the first act). Take care your narrative doesn't just flip back and forth like this. The third turn is a special turn, because it designates the ending. Your protagonist can't just make a right turn into anywhere; they have to end up somewhere that completes the narrative. For the purpose of your third turn, note that, if you make three right-angled turns, you end up heading in the same direction you began: To ensure the turn is diametric, each time your protagonist makes a turn, work out where your protagonist is (their current position) and where they appear to be heading (their direction, motivation, goals, objectives), and either flip it, or contrast it in some major way. 3.5.1 Doubling: 'Doppelgängers and 'Flips' For instance, a protagonist police officer may be framed for a crime, prosecuted by the police force, and get sentenced to prison, where he befriends some of the prison inmates. Previously he saw the police as good, and the prison inmates as bad, but after the right angle turn (he gets convicted for a crime) he begins to see the police as bad and prison inmates as good. A 'doppleganger' is where that character, setting, or story element remains the same, but is duplicated, and the double is contrastingly different, if not entirely the opposite (like the 'good twin, evil twin' cliché). For instance, a character finds a portal to a fantasy world, which contain vague doubles of their real world counterparts (the Wizard of Oz 10 “…and you were there…and you were there…” idea). Often there is some kind of threshold dividing the doppelgängers, but there doesn't have to be. The more obvious the double, the more of a border exists between them — virtual twins are almost guaranteed to never meet. The more subtle a double, the more ability they can interact with their double. The point of this rule is, characters should not be aware they are doubles. The double is a concept related specifically to right-angle turn plots (right angles bestow double status), compared to a foil who is not necessarily a double, nor do they require a right-angle to exist. A double's existence is predicated on their 'twin' — apart from which, they don't really have a reason to exist. Whereas, a foil isn't dependent on its partner, rather, its traits have been adjusted to maximize contrast with another character. In both cases, the effect is to give the protagonist a new perspective. 3.5.2 Examples of Three Right Angle Turns To illustrate the concept in its entirety I'll use the examples of two very different stories: Beauty and the Beast, 11 and The Shawshank Redemption. 12 #1 Beauty and the Beast: Act 1: [Protagonist's starting position] Country village [Protagonist's direction] dreams of fairytale romance in some distant location with prince. Act 1 right angle: [New position] Scary castle with monster. Act 2: [Position] Captive of monster in scary castle Act 2 right angle: [New position] Falling in love with monster. Act 3: [Position] Falling in love with monster. Act 3 right angle: [New position] Monster is not a monster but prince. Conclusion: Protagonist ends up where they dreamed of in the first place. #2 The Shawshank Redemption: Act 1: [Protagonist's starting position] Protagonist's wife cheating on him [Protagonist's direction] possibly leave her, try to get her back, or get revenge. Act 1 right angle: [New position] Scary castle with monster. Act 2: [Position] protagonist in prison, lowest standing on the prison's social hierarchy, not coping Act 2 right angle: [New position] protagonist makes friends and gets a better standing Act 3: [Position] Protagonist coping in prison Act 3 right angle: [New position] Protagonist escapes prison Conclusion: Protagonist ends up where they should have been in the first place. 3.5.3 Sub- Three Right Angle Turns Beauty and the Beast is the poster child for the right-angle turn structure, and provides yet more examples. One example is in song themes. The songs 'Belle', 'Be Our Guest' and 'Kill the Beast' are all about belonging and exclusion (the remaining song) : Belle: the inhabitants of the setting (village) are telling an excluded/different character (Belle) she doesn't belong; Be Our Guest: the inhabitants of the setting (castle) are telling the excluded/different character she does belong; Kill the Beast: the inhabitants of the setting (village again) are once again reinforcing that an excluded/different character does not belong (now, the Beast); Bonus; 'Beauty and the Beast': the inhabitants (castle staff) reinforce the belonging of the two excluded/different characters (Belle, Beast) with each other. Symbolically, since they are the victors of the battle, their song is taken as the 'victory song'; i.e. whatever they say is the 'truth' or the winning argument. Notice the structure of these songs as an argument: team 1 makes a claim; team 2 rejoinders; team 1 reinforces its claim; team 2 reinforces its rejoinder, and ultimately wins the argument. Also notice the strategic spacing of the songs: if the film was divided into four acts, each of these songs would roughly correspond to each of these acts: beginning, end of second act halfway point, climax, denouement. Beauty and the Beast is a love story; you might ask where does the theme of love fit into this structure? Importantly, each of these songs is separated by an inciting incident which acts as the 'turn': Belle getting imprisoned in the castle (motivated by her love for her father) turns to 'Be Our Guest'; Belle staying at the castle after the wolf attack (motivated by her love for the Beast) turns to Kill the Beast; Beast returning to human form (because of Belle's love for him) turns to'Beauty and the Beast'; Each of the inciting acts symbolizes love, and results in a reply song symbolizing belonging. Love is the act, and belonging is the effect (or, countered by the antagonists; love is the threat and exclusion is the effect). 3.6: Chiastic Structure A chiastic structure exists where the narrative creates a symmetrical pattern, e.g. if scenes include A,B, and C, then a chiastic structure might go: A, B, C, C, B, A. If you're musically inclined, this resembles counterpoint. 'Chiastic' originates from the Greek word 'Chiasmus' meaning 'crosswise arrangement,' i.e. — Chiastic structure can effect a sense of 'circularity,' or going full circle, returning the reader back where they started. Elements are introduced, and then, as if a mirror reflection, are re-addressed and resolved in corresponding (backwards) order. Here is an example of the Chiastic structure of the Genesis Flood Narrative: 13 A: Noah and his sons (Gen 6:10) B: All life on earth (6:13:a) C: Curse on earth (6:13:b) D: Flood announced (6:7) E: Ark (6:14—16) F: All living creatures (6:17—20) G: Food (6:21) H: Animals in man's hands (7:2—3) I: Entering the Ark (7:13—16) J: Waters increase (7:17—20) X: God remembers Noah (8:1) J': Waters decrease (8:13—14) I': Exiting the Ark (8:15—19) H': Animals (9:2,3) G': Food (9:3,4) F': All living creatures (9:10a) E': Ark (9:10b) D': No flood in future (9:11) C': Blessing on earth (9:12—17) B': All life on earth (9:16) A': Noah and his sons (9:18,19a) 3.6.1 Sub-Chiastic Structure As plots may contain sub-plots, chiastic structures may contain sub-chiastic structures. To do this, take one of the items on your list of elements, e.g. from above: 'G: Flood announced.' Then insert a minor chiastic structure after, before progressing to the next item, e.g. A: Noah and his sons B: All life on earth C: Curse on earth D: Flood announced G: Flood announced G1: 7 days until flood G2: Noah is skeptical G3: Noah becomes convinced G2: The townspeople are skeptical G1: 7 days to build the ark 3.7: Plots with Problems 3.7.1 P.R.O.B.L.E.M Bork 14 says at the heart of any story is a problem, which need to have seven characteristics, (a little too conveniently) creating the acronym PROBLEM: Punishing It's long (lasts the whole story), every scene is spent trying to solve the problem. It may be complicated or get more complicated as the story goes on. Relatable Easy to identify with the problem on a human level. We care about the character's struggle, we stay invested. Original Something about the story is fresh and new, even if fits in conventional storytelling or genre. There is a spark of uniqueness to the idea or the way it's told. Believable It easy to accept or understand the problem, and feels real, seems driven by identifiable wants, needs and behaviour. Life-Altering The mission to resolve the problem is of huge importance to the charaters. If the problem isn't solved, life will be unthinkably worse for them. Something critical or primal is at stake. If the problem is solved, things will be much better. Entertaining The problem-solving process is fun to read and creates the desired emotional responses in the reader. Meaningful The reader comes away feeling that value has been added to their life, the story was worthwhile and resonates with them beyond the time spent reading it. It's get more complicated as the story goes on. Knowing the story's central problem gives you a head-start to writing the logline. 3.7.2 Bork's Story Problems Bork lists eight main types of story problems: Someone or something is trying to kill me (or us). Someone or something is trying to destroy my life as I know it. I have a once-in-a-lifetime but incredibly difficult opportunity to rise up and be somebody, in a big way, that could forever change my sense of self. I have to rescue someone from a potentially terrible fate. I have to reach a distant and life-changing “prize,” which seems nearly impossible to do. I have to defeat powerful “bad guys” who have hurt and/or are threatening innocents. I have to escape a terrible situation, which prevents me from living freely and happily. I have to win over and/or hang on to a desired life partner, with whom I have a chance at my best life. But something is hugely in the way of that. 3.7.3 Snyder's Story Problems Blake Snyder 15 says all stories centre around one of these 10 problems: Monster in the House Characters are trapped in a confined space with a 'monster' or dangerous entity out to get them. Golden Fleece The 'quest' myth: a hero goes on a journey in search of something, encountering interesting things or people along the way. Normally, by the end, the hero has undergone a personal transformation. Out of the Bottle A wish comes true for the protagonist or they get something akin to magic — for better or worse. Doesn't have to be supernatural (e.g. someone accidentally comes into a fortune). The flipside is the wish ends up being a curse. Dude with a Problem An ordinary guy (or girl) finds himself in extraordinary circumstances. Rites of Passage Involve characters going through traditional milestone events (school, first relationship, wedding, mid-life crisis, etc) Buddy Love Two characters navigating plot problems together. Usually the buddies are opposites or in conflict, but learn to cooperate and appreciate each other. Whydunnit Normally detective stories, an exploration of human nature and the dark side of humanity. The Fool Triumphant Involve an underdog, a 'little, silly, and overlooked man' as protagonist, set against a 'big establishment,'' who in the end is the one made the fool of. Institutionalized Involves a group as the protagonist (or the protagonist's being indivisibly part of a larger group). The group may be a family, or have no relation other than all being in the same circumstances, e.g. colleagues, or soldiers, or mental patients. The group dynamic is often crazy and self-destructive, the themes relate to identity and the danger of herd mentality. Superhero The opposite of 'Dude With A Problem' — here, an extraordinary guy in an ordinary world. The person might be good or bad or just different. They don't have to be supernatural. 3.7.4 Problems with Plots Howard Mittelmark and Sandra Newman list common problems with plots: 16 I. The Lost Sock The plot is too slight or trivial. The plot of a story “should be important enough to change someone's life forever.” 17 It should also have broad interest — just because you find something fascinating, doesn't mean the broader public does. Solutions: Ensure your plot revolves around a dilemma involving a 'sex word' (see 6.2 Sex Words); Ensure your story is not a thinly veiled excuse for venting or proselytizing; Make sure character or plot trivia is brief and in the background, not the foreground. II. The Waiting Room The substance of the plot is too long delayed. Readers don't want to 'settle into' a story; they want to start from the first sentence. Solutions: Start the story as late as possible — i.e. as close as possible to the first important scene; Smuggle description into active scenes; Remove introspection; suggest thoughts and feelings through behaviour and dialogue; III. The Long Runway A protagonist's childhood is recounted for no purpose. Readers don't need to know everything about your protagonist; only as much necessary for the plot to make sense. Solutions: Get rid of childhood memories if the plot makes sense without them; Smuggle description into active scenes; Explicate your protagonist's character through present action and conflict IV. The Vacation Slide Show Author substitutes location for story. Solutions: Settings should be described only to enrichen or add dimension to the plot; Settings should be described in a way which says something about the characters who find themselves there (rather than your favourite bits, or the bits remembered best by you) Alter or make up parts of settings which serve your plot better. Ensure description of the setting is not being 'contaminated' by your personal opinion; e.g. words like 'unbelievable' and 'amazing' are suspect. V. The Smoking Gun The reader is unintentionally mislead by details irrelevant to the plot. Readers will assume that significant or interesting elements introduced throughout a story will have a payoff later, otherwise the reader may feel cheated. Solutions: Ensure everything in your story furthers the plot. VI. Don't Mind Him A character's problems remain unexplored. If characters have their own issues, these need to be resolved. Solutions: Address problems with their own plot arcs Make sure subplots don't overshadow the main plot; otherwise minimize or remove them. VII. The Deafening Hug The unintended love interest. If a protagonist gives the slightest suggestion of flattering another character, the reader will run with it, inferring the protagonist is in love with the character (no matter how absurd or taboo). Solutions: Tone down flattering descriptions of characters (particularly physical attributes); Draw more focus to characters' flaws (or give them flaws in the first place); 3.8: Story Planning 3.8.1 Bottom-Up and Top-Down Bottom-up (BU) writing means creating the tiny details first, and organising structure and story later. Top-down (TD) writing the opposite. Think of it like building a house: BU means laying the bricks first, working out how big each room will be later. TD means sketching your measurements first, so you know how many bricks you'll need, and exactly where they'll go, before you start laying them. A writer who says 'I make it up as I go along' is a BU writer. BU writing has its advantages. The problem is the writing community is almost exclusively reliant on it, and for the wrong reasons. Word count Olympics such as 'NaNoWriMo' and Stephen King's method of setting word count quotas fosters bottom up writing, causing top-down writing skill to atrophy. Pretty soon BU and writing are interchangeable and TD is entirely disregarded. Example of BU planning: There'll be a character called Dave Driver. He has a moustache. He wears a suit. He's a detective. He is cynical, but always first into office. A lawyer he used to hate became a barrister and then a judge. The judge slips implied insults in at the detective during court hearings. There are two prisons, one called 'The Small Wolf,' and one called 'The Big Wolf,' — ironically, the former is even worse than the latter. Someone smuggles a pet into the prison but it gets killed in a feud which kicks off a revenge sub-plot. Inmates write secret messages on playing cards and pass them to each other. An accused killer hates the sight of blood, but the prosecutor thinks this is faked. When he was a kid, the prosecutor saw someone drown, but didn't alert anyone to help...etc. Example of TD Planning: It'll be a supernatural crime story. In the first Act there'll be a really strange murder. In the second Act the perpetrator is suspected innocent by the unpopular detective, but the body goes missing. In the third Act the detective has to fight the system to prevent the innocent getting executed, and get him out of prison. At the conclusion the victim turns out to be a shapeshifter (or intelligent zombie). The detective fails to prevent execution of the innocent, but he was infected by the zombie anyway, so it's a bittersweet ending as the innocent accepts the execution, but the detective doesn't. In the epilogue, it's implied the execution failed, because the innocent is now a zombie/shapeshifter as well — maybe his body has gone missing from the morgue. BU planning it takes a long time — if at all — to get an entire plot? But in TD planning you end up with a plot outline really quickly. 3.8.2 Word Generation is not Storytelling Don't get word generation confused with story writing. When you write, making it up as you go along (or start off with BU writing), you're experimenting with idea generation, but you have no story. Remember, from '1.2.3 More than a Series of Events,'' a story is not merely a series of events or details. It has gestalt meaningfulness. The example of BU planning above, is not a story. It's a series of events or details — any one of them can be added or removed without substantive loss or gain. The example of TD planning, above, is a story. You cannot remove any single element without changing the overall meaning. 3.8.3 Plot Pressures In a game of chess you can never play a completely free game where you can make any move you want. You're always under pressure to some extent by your opponent's moves (as your opponent is constrained by your moves). In a story, every character's actions are under narrative pressures, being setting, other characters' actions, general events, etc. You want the reader to be convinced your protagonist acted naturally the way they did. In a game of chess, if the opponent's queen is available to you, you take it, unless there is a good reason you don't want to win. This is the same in a story; if certain actions are open to the protagonist, and they don't take them -- and there is no previously established reason why -- your character will not be convincing. They will be seen as a puppet. External pressures tend to be more persuasive than internal pressures . For instance, saying 'the protagonist didn't do X because he's dumb' is an internal pressure; it's easy but bad writing. Bad weather is an external pressure, but it's also easy and unpersuasive. Good pressures tend to be a mix of internal and external pressure foreshadowed in earlier scenes; i.e. protagonist is X type of person, therefore, in a type Y scenario, they're likely to fail. Finding a way to get this info across tacitly within the plot (as opposed to merely being expository) is part of good writing technique. Really good writers get this info across inobtrusively inside exciting plot-moving scenes, without you even realising it; it's only later when the 'Y scenario' eventuates, you flip back and realise it was always heading that way. A good story will early on introduce the protagonist as a X type of person (internal pressure) and that a Y type of scenario (external pressure) looms on the horizon. But, also show protagonist averting this — and failing. Then attempting to avert again — and failing. The situation grows more desperate as type Y scenario looms. Finally protagonist must confront type Y scenario. 3.9: Romance: Three Kinds This tip relates not only to romance genre stories but any plot with two love interests (LI) who get together by the end of the story. There are generally three kinds of romances: Pursuit; Revelation, and Conspiracy. (1) Pursuit The protagonist is in love and spends the story actively pursuing their LI. Usually, the LI either doesn't know the protagonist exists, or doesn't know the 'true' protagonist. Plot points should work to keep the LIs as apart as possible, motivating the protagonist to re-double his/her efforts to pursuit. This means putting up obstacles in protagonist's way, and making him/her overcome them. The LIs need not be kept physically apart. The protagonist may already be very close to the LI, but have some secret true self they have not revealed to the LI (e.g. a superhero alter ego, or something more subtle). For instance, in tragicomic romance Cyrano de Bergerac, love interests Cyrano and Roxane are frequently together and interacting, but never in a relationship, because both characters hide their true desires from each other. Types of Pursuit (A) Direct Pursuit If the plot trajectory is a strict pursuit of the LI, the pursuit is 'direct'. The 'rescue' is the most classic form: the LI (e.g. a princess) is kidnapped, and the protagonist (e.g. a knight) goes to save her. The obstacle may be the physical distance separating the LIs, or a dangerous situation or threat. Once the obstacle has been overcome, mutual union is virtually guaranteed. (B) Pursuit by Proxy The protagonist engages in a pursuit whose reward is not the LI themselves, but a resource which will help the protagonist win the LI. This means there are actually two pursuits: the plot obstacle, and winning the LI. Failing the first does not eliminate the second, but conversely, winning the first does not guarantee the second. You have latitude to go for a 'Pixar' ending here; regardless of the obstacle outcome (won or lost) it does not represent the story's ultimate resolution. Instead, the protagonist successfully utilizes the lessons learned in the process to win the love interest in an oblique way. It may be creative, but should seem to be simpler or make more intuitive sense; avoid an oblique victory which completely invents a never before referenced method for winning the LI. The victory should not introduce new story material; it's got to conclude everything that's come before. Potential Pitfalls of Pursuit (A) The Love Interest is the obstacle The obstacle should not be the protagonist's refusal to accept 'no'. Thus, the obstacle should not be the LI his/herself (i.e. his/her dismissal of the protagonist). The LI should never say 'no.'' If a protagonist pursues a LI who has dismissed them, they have become deluded. The obstacles should hinder protagonist's attempts to so much as get close to the LI, or enable him to ask her out or charm her. This is probably why the cliché 'rescue' is so popular; it's a useful obstacle to keep the LIs apart without any unfortunate intimation the 'damsel' is deliberately separating herself from the protagonist. LIs may have disagreements with the protagonist (it's more interesting than a 'yes man' character), but it should be mutual rather than a 'I'm right, you're wrong' scenario. In a good resolution, both characters learn, grow and change, and admit they were wrong before reconciling. (B) The Love Interest's will is overcome Avoid the unfortunate implication that the LI has been overcome by sheer brute force. This is particular problem with the rescue pursuit, where the protagonist has done something so massively favourable to the LI (such as saving their life), the LI is put in an uncomfortable situation where they practically must accept the protagonist as an eligible suitor, compatibility be damned! A story may be susceptible to this where the pursuit involves intense or lengthy effort. It militates away from the LI's agency/latitude to select what they want, and characters who lack separate goals from the protagonist are generally weak and un-engaging characters. It is more meaningful if the LI has the latitude to choose, but ultimately does select the protagonist freely. You may even emphasize their free choice by putting the LI in a position where selecting the protagonist would entail risks or stakes, and the LI chooses them anyway. This may create a 'reverse pursuit' where the LI bears hardship to pursue the protagonist — much more satisfying than if it was one-sided. (2) Revelation The protagonist isn't in love initially, but later in the story, comes to a revelation that they have fallen in love with someone who was there all along. In contrast to 'pursuit' the plot should work to keep the LIs as together as possible, even against their personal preferences. There may be some exterior device to justify this: the LIs are members of a team tasked with some objective, and fall in love incidentally, or even at the risk of the objective (to create conflict and suspense). Such a device is especially necessary if LIs despise or deride each other initially. An example of the Revelation is Silver Linings Playbook. 18 The romance type is different depending which LI is the protagonist. From the male's point of view, it's a revelation, but if the female was the protagonist, it would be a pursuit. Potential Pitfalls of Revelation (A) Unlikeable Love Interests Conflict in a revelation romance can be heightened the more LIs oppose each other. But oppositional LIs does not mean annoying, confrontational, disagreeing LIs. Sexual tension does not mean characters have to snap at each other over minor disagreements. Bad revelations read like stories where LIs sit around all day stewing on how annoying it would be to have sex with the other — incredibly uncompelling. The protagonist should want to have sex with the LI, but it's not open to them in the circumstances — this is what creates the sexual tension; the characters want, but cannot have each other, yet must stick together anyway to complete some plot task. Do not try to hide this fact from the audience, they know better. Protagonists who hide behind a resentful fantasy that the LI is annoying and obnoxious shoot themselves in the foot. Either the LI is truly obnoxious, or the protagonist is the obnoxious one for falsely claiming the LI is. Either way, one or both of your characters is obnoxious and risks audience disengagement and sympathy. The same rule for obstacles under pursuit romances apply to the obstacles for revelation: characters should be blindsided by the developing romance due to external pressures, not internal pressures. Internal pressures occur inside the characters themselves, e.g. lack of insight that one has a crush, refusal to admit they could ever fall for that type of person, not wanting to be in a relationship, etc. External pressures are forced upon the character from outside: e.g. having to choose between LI and an important assignment/task, spending time with LI ingratiates protagonist into LIs 'world' which has bad points, spending time with LI is necessary but costly, etc. (3) Conspiracy It's evident the LIs love each other deeply, but the externalized obstacle is broad and sweeping, possibly global, cultural — the story's entire milieu is the antagonist. It's usually some outside force (e.g. their small-minded community) set upon keeping them apart. There is an understanding the union breaks the accepted rules and customs or infringes some social code, or risks some great harm to society. Alternatively, it may bring about a bad event. Or, maybe nothing bad would happen, rather a good thing would be foreclosed. It doesn't matter if the risk would not happen, only that the antagonist is convinced it would happen — often the conclusion involves realizing the antagonist's dire projections were proven categorically wrong. Examples of the conspiracy romance include Romeo and Juliet, 19 1984, 20 and Twilight. 21 It may also be an internal obstacle: the LIs own consciences dissuading them from union. It may be mundane: one LI has a medical or mental condition which makes union more challenging. If a protagonist is gradually being destroyed by the relationship's toll or even dies, it almost definitely is a Conspiracy. 3.9.1 Main Differences Between the Three Types These romances may overlap, the main distinction where the LIs begin the story, in terms of how they feel towards each other. In a Pursuit , the affection is initially unilateral, which is what drives the pursuit. The end goal is the pursuit becoming mutual (the LI reciprocating the affection); In a Revelation , the affection is non-existent initially, although not necessarily mutually so — the LI may like the protagonist, but cannot be the converse. The main plot goal drives the story, and the inevitable emergence of affection creates a kind of obstacle (more accurately, the plot goal is the obstacle of the affection); In a Conspiracy , the affection is present initially. The goal is not for the relationship to begin or develop, but to endure. If anything, the relationship may slowly risk eroding or destructing as the story progresses. Different types of romance work for different genres: pursuits work well for almost anything, particularly adventure and action, but not horror. Revelation works better in horror. Conspiracy works well for time-period altered stories (set in the future or past) or anything with background lore, but not so well for action or adventure. 3.9.2 Other Types There might conceivably be other types of romances, such as romantic tragedies such as 'unrequited romances' or the traditional 'comic' romance where several characters are wrongly paired due to misunderstanding and switch to the correct partners at the conclusion. However, Chris Booker 22 would probably argue these are merely 'dark' versions of the established types, e.g: The unrequited romance is merely a 'dark' pursuit; the protagonist never actually gets the LI. 3.9.3 Final Note: Mixing It Up: Making these delineations is not to say a romance must follow them on rails. You might have a romance which fuses different elements of all three. For instance, a protagonist starts with a pursuit in the first act. By the end of the first act protagonist has successfully 'won' the LI, but now realizes he/she is different than first appeared (e.g. by deceit or misunderstanding). In the second act, the protagonist is stuck with the LI to the completion of a task, and in the meantime, gives them a second chance, getting to know them better (and accurately). In the third act, the protagonist has a revelation he/she has fallen in love with the accurate LI, but some larger force now conspires to keep them apart (bonus points if it was something the protagonist earlier set off after being insulted by the LIs deceit). Beauty and the Beast 23 is an example: the first act is a pursuit (Belle seeks a handsome prince via adventure); the second act is a revelation (Belle falls in love with the Beast); the third is a conspiracy (the villagers attempt to keep Belle and the Beast apart).

    "content": "The Hero's Journey “You enter the forest at the darkest point, where there is no path. Where there is a way or path, it is someone else's path. You are not on your own path. If you follow someone else's way, you are not going to realize your potential.” — Joseph Campbell Act I. Departure (1.1) The Call to Adventure This event signals the beginning of the mythological journey. There are countless forms this might take. Generally, the protagonist is voluntarily or involuntarily lured away 'from the frequented paths of man.'' The occurrence may be by accident - e.g. blunder of the protagonist's doing, or the act of another. Another character (the 'herald') may give the protagonist the call to adventure. Usually, the 'herald' is 'dark, loathly, or terrifying, judged evil by the world' representing the 'rejected, unrecognised' unknown into which the protagonist must go. If there is no herald, the setting itself may possess these qualities, such as a dark forest. (1.2) Refusal of the Call The protagonist does not immediately answer the call. He may actively or passively refuse it, outright reject it, or bide his time, or unintentionally avoid it. But as long as the protagonist denies the call, his life will get worse or forces will conspire to compel him to answer the call. A series of 'signs of increasing force then will be made visible, until…the summons can no longer be denied.' (1.3) Supernatural Aid Once the protagonist has accepted the call (or around this time), he will encounter a 'protective figure,'' a guide or teacher, who gives the adventurer some kind of protective measure against the antagonistic forces he is to face against. This is usually a 'wise old mentor' type character. He is both 'protective and dangerous.' The protagonist must place trust in the protective figure, as it will infrequently tell the protagonist everything. The protective figure is normally male, but doesn't have to be. As 'the lurer of the innocent soul into the realm of trial', the figure is normally a force of good, but doesn't have to be (as Mephistopheles in Faust) - if the protagonist is called/tempted to do something bad, the figure may be bad. The Call to Adventure is typically the first announcement of the protective figure's imminent coming. (1.4) The Crossing of the First Threshold The protagonist has a 'life horizon.'' This is the limits of his life's experience of the land/world. Beyond the life horizon are the places he's never gone, or doesn't know exist; 'the unknown.'' If the quest is emotional or psychological, the 'unknown' will be the unexplored parts of himself; 'the abyss,'' into which the 'consciousness descends in dream, and the individual dissolves.'' This is demarcated by 'the threshold,'' which is the entrance to 'the unknown.'' The protagonist must cross the 'threshold' to proceed in his adventure. The threshold may be magical. The 'threshold' is watched by a 'threshold guardian,'' who acts like a parental figure, ensuring the 'infant' protagonist does not wander beyond the 'tribe' out into danger. This guardian is “content, even proud, to remain within the indicated bounds, and popular belief gives him every reason to fear so much as the first step into the unexplored.” This belief may refer to danger or temptation into sin. The guardian may be dangerous and dealing with them may be risky, requiring competence and courage. (1.5) The Belly of the Whale The passage through the threshold symbolizes a metamorphosis; a rebirth into a new world, but also a symbolic death, as the protagonist is “swallowed into the unknown, and would appear to have died.” This doesn't necessarily entail the protagonist's bodily death (though it may), it may involve the death of the protagonist's ego, lifestyle, or other identifying feature. The crossing of the threshold signifies the protagonist will never be the same. Act II. Initiation (2.1) The Road of Trials Once across the threshold, the protagonist may find himself in a dreamlike landscape where he must survive a succession of trials, tests or ordeals. In this, the protagonist is aided by the protective advice or gifts of the protective figure. Trials may include slaying monsters or dragons and passing through barriers, throughout which there will be momentary glimpses of wonder and victory. One of these trials may be the protagonist's discovery of his opposite. This is a self-confrontation as the opposite symbolizes his unsuspected self. The protagonist initially resists the opposite, but, one by one, the resistances are broken. He overcomes the opposite by putting aside his pride, virtue, beauty and/or life, and either swallow or be swallowed by the opposite (i.e assimilation), thereby finding he and it are not differing species, but the same flesh. This is a throwback to the symbolic 'death' earlier; one step of a larger quest of illumination through the ego putting itself to death. (2.2) The Meeting with the Goddess Once all the barriers have been passed and the dragons and ogres have been slain, the ultimate adventure is commonly represented as a 'mystical marriage' of the protagonist with the 'Queen Goddess of the World.'' This is the 'crisis at the nadir' or zenith, 'at the uttermost edge of the earth, the central point of the cosmos' or 'within the darkness of the deepest chamber of the heart.' This may mean the marriage presents a source of crisis or conflict for the protagonist, for example, gaining the Goddess in marriage necessitates the loss of something else of value to the protagonist. The 'Queen' herself (if a she) may be the paragon of beauty and “the reply to all desire, the bliss-bestowing goal of every hero's earthly and unearthly quest.' She may be a 'Lady of the House of Sleep,' i.e. in stasis or sleep until the hero awakens her (which may be symbolic). This figure can be ‘bad’ as well; absent, unattainable, forbidden, punishing, a lure to dangerous desire, and whose marriage would be the absolute ruin of the protagonist. The woman represents life, and by the marriage, the protagonist becomes the knower and master of life. When the protagonist is female, it is she instead who gains the qualities of the Goddess – beauty, yearning – becoming fit for consort with an immortal (hero). This character may also be embodied in ‘the Mother-Destroyer,’ who is a protecting and nourishing figure. She is ‘the world creatrix, ever mother…and is the life of everything that lives.’ She is also ‘the death of everything that dies…the womb and the tomb…’ Thus she has dual aspects; the terrible and the benign. (2.3) Woman as the Temptress If the Queen also embodies the Mother, the marriage puts the protagonist in his father’s place, as a kind of inevitable ascendancy. This can create an Oedipean conflict for the protagonist. As in that myth, the woman may become a symbol not of desire and victory, but of revulsion and defeat. She does not represent innocence, but is a ‘Queen of Sin.’ The quest to annihilate his ego may necessitate abstaining from woman’s temptation. (2.4) Atonement with the Father Like the ‘Mother’ the ‘Father’ figure initially has dual aspects; a terrifying ‘ogre’ who punishes when the protagonist does wrong, and a ‘protector,’ who warns against danger. The protagonist is kept steeped in ‘sin’ (i.e. his problems) as long as he fixates on his ego, which appears to protect him from the ‘ogre’ Father – this is reinforced by the protagonist’s unrealistic perception of the Father as an ‘ogre’. The protagonist endures the Father with support from the Mother. However, the Father eventually comes to shatter the protagonist’s ego, the protagonist must cast away his myth of the Father as ‘ogre’ whereon the protagonist actually finds that the Father and the Mother “reflect each other, and are in essence, the same.” The protagonist may rival the Father for ‘mastery of the universe,’ i.e. position as the Father. The Father entrusts his office only to a protagonist who has been purged of all “inappropriate infantile cathexes” and whose personal motives (of self-aggrandizement, personal preference or resentment) do not conflict with the exercise of the office powers. These ‘cathexes’ may be weaknesses or flaws, inexperience, ignorance, or naïve illusions about the way things work. The Father has an experience of the “majesty of cosmic law, purged of hope and fear, and [is] at peace in the understanding of the revelation of being.” (2.5) Apotheosis This step is a bit strange, but the protagonist may not only take the place of the Father, but also the Mother, simultaneously. By doing this, he becomes ‘godlike,’ representing both the two halves: Masculine and Feminine of the whole – this is a hermaphroditic, bisexual god. What is meant by this is that the Father and Mother being distinct is merely an illusion, they are one and the same in their role (the Mother ‘birthed’ the protagonist’; the Father gave the protagonist his ‘rebirth’, the Father protected the protagonist from danger, while the Mother protected the protagonist from the Father). They are both creators and destroyers: the Mother creates the protagonist, which leads to his breakdown by the Father, who builds him back up. This also overlaps with the previous step, if the ‘Father’ also symbolizes God or a god, then by assuming the Father’s place, the protagonist also becomes a god. In the Freudian sense, there is extra circularity in that the protagonist was once the Father previously (helped to be birthed by the Father) and so was always the Father. Your symbolic Father could likewise have some originating influence in the protagonist’s quest (e.g. setting off initial events), such that the protagonist could be said to have come from the Father. Realising the Mother and Father are the same results in enlightenment. Having experienced both life and death (creation and destruction) the protagonist now understands both and neither desires nor fears either, and at the end is apotheosis; the protagonist’s ascension into perfection, the total freedom from the self-torturing, delusional, tangled state of man, from consciousness, ego, and self, and human desires. The protagonist now neither desires nor fears, he is what was desired and feared. Apotheosis may mean the protagonist’s realization of his full potential. (2.6) The Ultimate Boon This traditionally refers to a treasure or trophy of some sort, a ‘cornucopian banquet of the gods.’ This is basically a reward or ultimate prize acquired by the protagonist upon completing the quest. It may be wealth, status, health, knowledge, valuable resource, skill, etc. The protagonist has won this through apotheosis, as this trophy symbolizes the treasure of the gods – only a god may possess it, so it’s value will be exaggerated or emphasized – in rarity, quantity, pricelessness, utility, desirability, etc. It will tend to be something only one person can possess, and possession indicates that the possessor is a god. Act III. Return Most of the Act III Steps have Act I counterparts, because they are ‘upside down’ versions of those in Act I. It’s as if the protagonist is moving backwards (through each stage) to the starting position again. (3.1) Refusal of the Return Once the quest has been accomplished, the protagonist must begin the labour of returning with his ‘boon.’ The boon may be some elixir for the restoration of society, or otherwise have life-renewing abilities to be applied to the original community, or – if the ‘sleeping princess’ is the boon – taken away from danger to the safety of the original homeplace. Just as the protagonist first refused the call, here, the protagonist will first refuse the responsibility to return. It may be the protagonist doubts the viability of his return, or its purpose, or he may want to take up permanent residence in the quest land. As forces pushed the protagonist to begin his journey, forces will commission him to return. They may be external, or internal. (3.2) The Magic Flight Once the protagonist has been commissioned to return, he will do so supported by the power of his ‘supernatural patron.’ This is the ‘god’ whose blessing he has (symbolically) won in the ‘apotheosis’ stage. Alternatively, if the protagonist attained the boon against the opposition of its guardian/god/demon then (like Prometheus and the stolen fire) the protagonist’s return may be resented by the gods or demons, and there may be a pursuit. The flight may be “complicated by marvels of magical obstruction and evasion.” In other words, the flight is magical either because the assenting god supports it (the magic providing for it), or opposes it (the magic creating obstacles). The Act I equivalent is 'Supernatural Aid,’ in which the protagonist ‘flight’ from his community is supported by the magical protective figure. It may be the same force. (3.3) Rescue from Without The protagonist may have to be rescued from his supernatural adventure by ‘without’ – i.e. the natural world he originally left. This is like the child who is called back inside after dark – the world the protagonist left behind calls to him again. If the protagonist is consciously unwilling to return, he will suffer a nasty shock, driving him (from within) to return. If, on the other hand, the protagonist is unconsciously unwilling to return; in a higher, beatific state of perfect being (resembling death), so cut off from his forgotten original starting place, a ‘rescue from without’ is necessary to get him back. (3.4) The Crossing of the Return Threshold The protagonist must pass back from the ‘mystic world’ to re-enter, with his boon, the ‘world of common day…where men who are fractions imagine themselves to be complete.’ The last part suggests the common society would not relate to the protagonist’s quest (reinforcing the hero’s ‘death’; that he is no longer like them). As the Mother and Father are actually one, the two worlds are actually one – the mystic world is merely “a forgotten dimension of the world we know.” From different perspectives, “the hags [are] goddesses and the dragons [are] the watchdogs of the gods.” However, a certain baffling incongruence between the worlds, perpetuating the need for another hero to redeem the world. Now a god, the protagonist must return to the earthly world of men. The protagonist may struggle to accept the “passing joys and sorrows, banalities and noisy obscenities” of his previous world. However, his apotheosis may fade as a dream which was momentous by night, seeming silly in the light of day. As compromise, the protagonist may occupy an ‘in-between’ position on an ‘insulating horse.’ The protagonist may walk amongst the common society, but not on the same ground; he has knowledge, skill or ability they don’t, and they may recognise it, even if they treat him the same. The ‘insulating horse’ sets him apart from them. It may act as a precaution for his sake, or theirs, since he may be dangerous to them now. The protagonist may have some sign or mark or indicator of his distinction from them. The returning hero must survive the impact of the world. This may entail a confrontation with the common society with his “ego-shattering, life-redeeming elixir, [he must] take the return blow of reasonable enquiries, hard resentment, and good people at a loss to comprehend.” The protagonist may be celebrated, or disbelieved, ridiculed or rejected. (3.5) Master of the Two Worlds The protagonist has gained and proved his talent to pass back and forth between the world division, gaining the insight of both. (3.6) Freedom to Live Before the quest, the protagonist may have doubted his worth, but having proved his worth by the completion of the quest, gives the protagonist a will or purpose to live and feel justified in his own life. He has surrendered himself to a higher purpose or action, losing his ego in the process, freeing him from selfishness and suffering. Summary To summarise the Hero's Journey: The mythological hero, setting forth from his common-day hut or castle, is lured, carried away, or else voluntarily proceeds to the threshold of adventure. There he encounters a shadow presence that guards the passage. The hero may defeat or conciliate this power and go alive into the kingdom of the dark (brother battle; dragon battle; offering; charm), or be slain by the opponent and descend in death (dismemberment, crucifixion). Beyond the threshold, then, the hero journeys through a world of unfamiliar yet strangely intimate forces, some of which severely threaten him (tests), some of which give magical aid (helpers). When he arrives at the nadir of the mythological round, he undergoes a supreme ordeal and gains his reward. The triumph may be represented as the hero's sexual union with the goddess-mother of the world (sacred marriage), his recognition by the father-creator (father atonement), his own divinization (apotheosis), or again—if the powers have remained unfriendly to him—his theft of the boon he came to gain (bride-theft, fire-theft); intrinsically it is an expansion of consciousness and therewith of being (illumination, transfiguration, freedom). The final work is that of the return. If the powers have blessed the hero, he now sets forth under their protection (emissary); if not, he flees and is pursued (transformation flight, obstacle flight). At the return threshold the transcendental powers must remain behind; the hero re-emerges from the kingdom of dread (return, resurrection). The boon that he brings restores the world (elixir).

    "content": "Themes “There are half a dozen subjects that I return to time and time again...[b]ecause most of my favourite writers do that, to hunt down the same topic or theme from different directions each time.” — David Bowie “Thematic significance in a novel arises from an exaggerated impression of life.” — Mark Twain “To produce a mighty book, you must choose a mighty theme.” — Ernest Hemingway 4.1: What is Theme? [Stories with themes contain] “experiences [that] comment on life, leaving the reader with some conclusion about the nature of existence that can be factually verified.” — Robert Meredith and John Fitzgerald 1 [Themes are v]alues, the positive/negative charges of life, [which] are at the soul of our art. The writer shapes story around a perception of what's worth living for, what's worth dying for, what's foolish to pursue, the meaning of justice, truth — the essential values. — Robert McKee 2 Themes can be simple and absolute, or complex and variable. They can be optimistic or pessimistic. They can affirm the status quo or attempt to subvert it. They can be cliché or novel, obtuse or illuminating, pretentious or unassuming, cerebral or illogical. They can be familiar and comforting or bizarre and disconcerting. One of the most common themes in stories is that good ultimately triumphs over evil. Hart 3 which just keep repeating themselves. This is a virtue, as good themes endure, they speak to universal human experience -- they're not meant to reinvent the wheel. Hart quoted Paula LaRoque's list of themes or archetypes: Quest, Search, Journey, Pursuit, Capture, Rescue, Escape, Love, Forbidden love, Unrequited love, Adventure, Riddle, Sacrifice, Discovery, Temptation, Loss or gain of identity, Metamorphosis, Transformation, Dragon-slaying, Descent into an underworld, Rebirth, Redemption, Hart also adds: Maturation, Accepting flaws, Persistence in the face of longstanding or difficult challenges, Ultimately, all themes converge to seek cause, consequence, reason, and order. 4.2: The Thematic Conceit The theme can be phrased as a question, which the story answers. What are the central questions you want to put to the reader and write in order to answer? e.g. — Love: can it survive unimaginable trauma? Time: is there any acceptable restitution if it's been lost? Entertainment: Does it make people dumber? Friendship: would you turn away from your friends to save yourself? Death: is there anything worse? The end of the story should provide something in the way of an answer to your thematic concern, e.g. 'In these circumstances, love could not survive unimaginable trauma, because as set out by the story, X, Y and Z reasons prevented it.' Your themes should be questions that you as the author personally agonise over and you have not found other literature which adequately — if at all — address or answer the questions. Many popular books utilize uncontroversial themes which pose false questions - e.g. 'Love: will it save in the end? - Yes, it will'. This is uninteresting and cliché. Rather than challenging the reader to question their beliefs and consider new perspectives, your work effects an echo chamber of the reader's pre-existing beliefs (and your own beliefs). It also lacks boldness and conviction; it raises the inference that you are terrified that someone will disagree with you or critically examine your work, that you want quick, popular approval (and remuneration) for your work. You may brainstorm scenes before characters, or vice-versa. I prefer to start with scenes because it's easier to insert characters into established scenes - e.g. if you want a scene where a husband and wife are in an argument which turns into domestic violence, you can then set about writing those characters accordingly. Whereas it's difficult to create characters and then work out what they should do because characters can potentially do anything you want them to if you give them the right incentive. 4.3: The Inciting Question For commercial writing, your premise and your thematic concern are the most vital commercial aspects of your story, because you draw upon them whenever you try to advertise your book. Consider a book is the primary advertisement for itself: ideally, your title, cover design, tagline, hook, and blurb will refer to your premise. All other advertisements will be based on these. Another way of putting it is each of your title, cover design, tagline, hook and blurb should ask a question that makes the reader want to read your book, e.g. 'What if you were the last to know?'' or 'Would you do it?'' This is not the theme, but a thematic question, a question which converges back on your theme. These also don't have to be literal questions, but should elicit a question, for instance: 'He looked at the closed casket as it disappeared into the ground, feeling the weight of being the only person who knew the body wasn't in there,'' (Theme: Honesty) or 'She allowed him to remove her white veil, and got a better look at his face. And - That's not Ivan. (Theme: Identity) 4.4: How to Create a Theme There are different methods for developing a theme: 4.3.1 Synecdoche Synecdoche is where a part of a thing represents the whole thing, or the whole represents a part. Normally the former is used to convey theme, such as where the relationship of two characters will make a comment on love (the theme) at large. The characters themselves may each constitute a synecdoche; the male character may represent men, the female character represent women, etc. 4.3.2 Symbolism Your theme can also be represented by dissimilar things. For instance, if your theme related to the passage of time, you can't show time literally passing, second by second, in the story, so you may use visual imagery to suggest its passing. 4.5: Don't Preach Under '1.1. The Main Elements of a Story,' Theme came last on the list. Plot comes first because your reader wants to be entertained above all else. If they wanted to learn something they would read non-fiction. When you make THEME come first, you end up with a lecture - or worse, propaganda - not a story. Your plot bends to facilitate your opinion, rather than reflect the most interesting arrangement of events. [If there's] one fault that stands out above all others...by the young and inexperienced [writers], it is the tendency to sermonize and editorialize to drive home the theme...[This] novelist is convinced of the validity of his wisdom, gained from experience, and he wants…to persuade others about [his] truth...as a result he begins to lecture the reader. — Robert Meredith and John Fitzgerald 4 4.6: Variations on a Theme This topic is an intersection of themes and character creation. You might select a premise or theme for your story but be unsure how to create and populate your plot with scenes that flow from your central idea or premise rather than just being 'really cool things that happen' which you just thought up. One technique you can apply is to think of stories as an exploration of an idea or premise, and have the freedom to explore all “variations on a theme”, or idea. Variations may be embodied in other characters whose own dramas vie with the protagonist for resolution. Additionally making these dramas a zero sum game can raise the stakes and also ensure the dramas are relevant to the protagonists'. Once you populate your plot with these variations major scenes and ideas may start to write themselves. One way to explore this is, if a character advancing one position exists, there must exist a character who advances the equal and opposite position. The main example is if a character exists embodying good values - we call this the 'hero' - there must exist a character embodying bad values - we call this the 'villain'. Take, for example, the Disney animated version of the Hercules myth, which goes further than the traditional good/bad polarization. Take the premise: there exists a good demi-god. This actually contains two dimensions: a good person and someone with half divine presence and half lack of it. The latter is a more complicated position because it's defined by the presence of something and the lack of it at the same time. It's not a polarity, therefore it creates not one but two alternate positions. Characters/protagonists who are 'half and half' or contain ambiguous shades of traits or status or identity are effective in stories where some underlying story message is not black and white, or that an issue is not resolved only taking one point of view. A story with a demi protagonist such as Hercules works to suggest Hercules' divine and mortal points of view are necessary to resolve some drama. The Disney movie may not have specifically intended this, and it's not that demi characters can only be in these such stories, but is worth knowing. We can derive two available anti positions: (a) There exists a bad God, and (b) there exists a bad human. The movie supplies these alternate explorations and form character material. There is also another opposition along a different dimension: There exists a good man. A position derived from that is: (a) There exists a bad woman. The movie also supplies this position. Polarities/oppositions don't just have to be positive/negative. Robert McKee 5 refers to the idea of negatives against negatives. Basically, the idea there is a state opposing negativity which is to negativity what negativity is to positivity. A state even more negative than negative, but also opposite.
