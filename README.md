to do 
- [ ] add basic formatting:
  - [ ] colours
  - [ ] links/nav
- [ ] add header component 
- [x] footer content
- [ ] page elements (title/quote/banner/text sections)

- [ ] condense logline, synopsis and title as 'marketing'

- [ ] add a 'chapter' entry to prisma schema/db and link it to comment, so every comment not only is linked to a user, but also has a subject, so when you display comments, it doesn't display every comment, only the ones left on the relevant chapter page

- [ ] resize text or spacing in sidebar or alter so all the links fit
